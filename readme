Application Summary: SEC Document Management System
The SEC Document Management System is a robust, internally-focused web application designed to provide the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with a secure and audited platform for managing official documents.

Key Purpose and Security
The primary function of the application is to ensure that critical organizational documents are stored, categorized, and accessed securely, upholding data integrity and compliance standards. A key security feature is the pre-approval workflow: only staff members whose details have been whitelisted by a Super Admin can proceed to register and gain access to the system.

Core User Functions
The system is structured around the efficient handling of classified files:

File Management: Authenticated staff members can upload files, assigning them to specific categories (e.g., Policy Documents, Legal Filings) and adding descriptive tags for ease of retrieval.

Search and Retrieval: Staff can quickly view, filter, and search the document repository by category, filename, and tags.

Secure Download: Users are able to download documents, with all download activity being meticulously tracked.

Administrative Control and Auditing
The system maintains a strict hierarchy to safeguard operations:

Super Admin Role: A privileged user manages the system, including the crucial ability to input and approve new staff IDs, granting them eligibility to register.

Comprehensive Logs: Every significant action taken within the system—including logins, uploads, downloads, and user approvals—is recorded in a dedicated audit trail. These System Logs are accessible only to the Super Admin, ensuring complete accountability and oversight.

Technical Foundation
The application is built on a standard and reliable web development stack: PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. The use of PHP ensures secure back-end processing and database interaction, while the system's design employs secure password handling for user authentication.
